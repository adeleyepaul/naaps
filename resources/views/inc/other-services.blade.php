                                <p>Our practice moves the focus from within the individual to the interaction of the
                                    individual with the environment and the meaning the person gives to their
                                    experience.The essential focus of our service is a collaborative ‘Plan-Do-Review Model’. It is
                                    intended to be a resource for parents, staff members and the whole school community.
                                </p>

                                <p>Our practice acknowledges that teachers and parents are experts in their own
                                    rights and bring distinct complementary skills and knowledge to those of the
                                    psychologist to provide an effective partnership. The educational psychologist
                                    helps the group reach a shared understanding of how problems exist, what
                                    maintains them, and develop ideas for intervention plans. This requires a
                                    framework for working more creatively in the search for solutions to
                                    problems, action plans to implement interventions, and planned reviews to
                                    ensure the outcomes of our work are positive change. We see this as fundamental
                                    to an effective service to support schools with the ever-increasing demands
                                    placed on schools.

                                    through a ‘Plan-Do-Review’ Cycle which will enable a more proactive,
                                    intervention-oriented approach.
